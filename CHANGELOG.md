All notable changes to `intyga-verify` (Rust) are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- **Wire format: the DIV Intent Payload gained a REQUIRED `evidence` field, and it must be `null`.**
  `div-intent-verification` and `div-offline-intent` now carry `"evidence":null` in the signed bytes
  (DIV §4.3.4); `div-delegation`, `div-agent-authority` and `div-platform-intent` deliberately do
  not. `null` is signed and load-bearing, exactly as `requester.attestation`'s null is: it is the
  payload's explicit statement that the authorization was not conditioned on any external fact.
  Verification refuses a payload whose `evidence` key is absent, and refuses any non-`null` value
  rather than treating it as unconditioned — the same fail-closed-on-unknown rule as the
  `signerClass` registry, and checked before Local Payload Reconstruction so an unsupported payload
  shape does not surface as a parameter mismatch. Absent and `null` are distinguished explicitly;
  collapsing them would make the check a no-op. All golden vectors were regenerated.

- Align cross-language receipt and audit verification: platform receipts, agent-authority seals,
  self-certifying DID trust, single/multi-event bundles, embedded ES256 signatures, tenant sequence
  checks, checkpoint continuity, anchor quorum and Rekor. Shared executable fixtures cover valid
  artifacts and refusals; no wire format changes.
- Refuse unknown witness signature algorithms. Require identity-bound trust when the signed
  `requesterCannotApprove` rule is set; key-only trust cannot enforce requester identity.
- **BREAKING: `verify_approval_receipt` and `verify_approval_receipt_with_options` return
  `Result<Vec<String>, String>`** — the distinct approver identities whose signatures verified,
  sorted, as the TypeScript, Go, Java and Python verifiers already did. The set was computed and
  discarded, so Rust alone could not answer "who approved this". The identity is the key in
  `PublicKeys` mode and the DID in identity mode; it is empty for an `AUTO_APPROVED` receipt,
  because no human signed it. Call sites using `?` or `.is_err()` are unaffected; only a comparison
  against `Ok(())` needs updating.

- Recheck a verified delegation's expiry when it is used, under the approval call's
  `as_of_unix_secs`, clock skew and explicit `allow_expired` forensic override.
- **Refuse a forward-dated offline proof or delegation (DIV §5a.3 rule 3, §5a.6 step 1).** The
  window caps bounded a proof's WIDTH but never its POSITION, so a quorum-signed proof dated years
  ahead with a compliant 60-minute (or 72-hour) window verified today and kept verifying until that
  date. The check is unconditional — the audit/`allow_expired` override re-examines a proof that was
  valid and has lapsed, and does not reach one dated in the future.
- **Refuse a signed `requirement.requiredApprovals` below 1 (DIV §4.3.2).** §5 step 7's "at least
  `requiredApprovals`" is satisfied vacuously by 0, so the minimum is now enforced explicitly
  instead of by an undocumented floor.

## [1.0.0]

Initial public release.

- Offline approval-receipt verification (ES256 and WebAuthn) against a caller-supplied trust
  anchor — no Intyga secret, no network. Standard Rust crypto crates (`p256`, `sha2`, …), no
  bespoke cryptography.
- DEWP Core Profile primitives and §5.2 single-anchor signature verification, pinned by the shared
  cross-language golden vectors. §5.3 anchor-quorum evaluation and evidence-bundle parsing are
  deliberately out of scope — see the README's limits section.
